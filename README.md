# API NPS

### It is essential to understand the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of our customers, which is why the nps score exists, but it is not a quick or easy task to do the complete calculation. So this api was developed to register user surveys and emails for the API itself to send emails with the content of nps surveys and then do the necessary calculations and give the results.

Getting Started
=================

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.
